Furthermore, this mobile app use also some other libraries I did publish as separate components:

* [ionic-swing](https://github.com/fluster/ionic-swing) use for the swipeable cards feature
* [web-photo-filer](https://github.com/fluster/web-photo-filter) a web component to apply Instagram-like WebGL filters to photos

These last two web components are build using [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com).

**Available for iOS and Android, mobiles or tablets, as a PWA and on the web.**

## Getting Started

Once you have cloned this repository and if you are looking to serve or build the application, you will have first to define your own third party keys in `resources.ts`.

The Fluster app is both a mobile app and a PWA. Handling these different targets is possible with the help of the Angular CLI. However some files, like `index.html`, aren't dynamic and therefore need to be modified before serve or build with the help of Gulp commands. 

### Debug locally

Serve the PWA connected with the staging server:

```bash
gulp proxy
ionic serve
```

### Build mobile app

Build the iOS mobile Cordova app platform for the staging server:

```bash
gulp rmmockup
gulp staging
gulp cordova
ionic cordova build ios --prod -c staging
```

### Build PWA

Build the PWA platform for the staging server:

```bash
npm run pwa-staging
```
